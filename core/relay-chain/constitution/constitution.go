// Package constitution implements Phase 5 — Constitutional Replay Boundary Enforcement.
//
// This package makes authority boundaries explicit and machine-readable at runtime.
//
// Key declarations:
//   replay equality != governance legitimacy
//   observability != execution authority
//   replay reconstruction != semantic truth
//   deterministic execution != sovereign correctness
//
// The system exposes:
//   - What it owns (execution correctness, replay determinism)
//   - What it does NOT own (governance legitimacy, semantic truth)
//   - Execution rights (what can be executed)
//   - Governance boundaries (what requires external governance decision)
//   - Replay boundaries (what replay can and cannot prove)
